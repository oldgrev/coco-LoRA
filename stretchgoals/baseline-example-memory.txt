Answer:

It's about how people are voting for a douche or turd.

\begin{blockquote}
In this episode, Stan Marsh is torn between his friends Kyle Broflovski (a Republican) and Eric Cartman (a Democrat). He also has an interest in politics after watching CNN on television. The two boys try to convince him that their candidate will win the election by using facts from both sides of the political spectrum. However, when they realize he can not make up his mind, they decide to use scare tactics instead. They tell him that if John Kerry wins the election, then all Americans would be forced into gay marriages and abortions would become mandatory; however, if George W. Bush won the election, America would fall under Sharia law and everyone would have to wear burqas. This convinces Stan to vote for Bush. When it turns out that Kerry actually did win the election, Stan becomes upset at himself because he voted against what he wanted.

The episode aired on October 13, 2004, during the 2004 United States presidential election. In it, Eric Cartman and his friends try to influence the outcome of the election by pretending to be political pundits. This is similar to how political commentators such as Bill O'Reilly, Chris Matthews, Tucker Carlson, Joe Scarborough, and Sean Hannity are perceived.

Comment: I don't know why you say "similar", when they're actually *exactly* like that. They're literally just being their own version of those people.

South Park is an American animated television series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become infamous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town. Much like The Simpsons, SouthPark employs a very large cast of recurring adult characters

Joe: or if you have any kind of style at all
